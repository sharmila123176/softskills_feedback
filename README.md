# Abstract: Feedback Prompt for Soft Skills & Teamwork
Soft skills and teamwork are vital competencies in academic and professional settings. This project introduces an interactive feedback prompt system designed to assess individuals on key behavioral and collaborative parameters such as communication, listening, ownership, cooperation, and conflict resolution. The system enables peer or self-evaluation using a user-friendly interface that captures both quantitative ratings and qualitative comments.

The primary objective is to streamline the process of soft skill assessment in educational, internship, or project-based environments, encouraging reflective feedback and continuous improvement. The system ensures confidentiality, ease of use, and structured data collection, which can further be analyzed for team development and individual growth planning.
